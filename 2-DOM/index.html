    <title>Intro to DOM Manipulation</title>

<!-- 
    DOM stands of Document Object Model and it is what allows our JS to interact with the HTML and CSS of our page. The DOM specifies how browsers should create a model of an HTML page and how JS can access and update the contents of a web page while it's in the browser window.
        - the DOM is an object-oriented representation of a web page, which can be modified with a scripting language like JS. The DOM covers two primary areas:

        1. Makes a model of our HTML page
            - when the browser loads a webpage, it creates a model of the page in memory
            - the DOM specifies the way in which the browser should structure the model in what is called the DOM tree
                the DOM is called an object model because the DOM tree itself is made up of objects
            - each object represents a different part of an HTML document that is loaded in the browser window
        2. Accessing and changing elements in our HTML document using a scripting language.
            - the DOM also provides methods and properties to access and update different objects in the model, which in turn updates what the user sees in the browser

        - while working with the DOM tree, we generally access the element that we want to work with, and once we've selected that element(s), we can then manipulate it

        ACCESSING
            - Common methods for accessing a single element:
                - getElementById()
                - querySelector()
                    query by id name, tag name, class name, etc.

            - Common methods for accessing multiple elements:
                - querySelectorAll ()
                    - will grab ALL elements by whatever attribute we input
                - getElementsByClassName()
                - getElementsByTagName()

        MANIPULATING
            - Common methods/properties for working with HTML content:
                - innerHTML = ""
                - textContent = ""
                - createElement = ""

            - Common methods/properties for working with tag attributes
                - className / id
                - setAttribute ()
                    - once we have accessed the element we can set an attribute in said element
                - getAttribute ()
                    - will tell us any attributes associtiated with that element
